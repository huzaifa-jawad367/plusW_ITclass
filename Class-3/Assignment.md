# Assignment 3

This contains the implementation of the problems given in Assignment 3 by the PlusW IT training. 

The tasks were very simple so I tried to modify the tasks to make them a little more challenging for myself.

## Task 1:
Task 1 was implemented with a react frontend and a Flask backend. All the logic defined in the Assignment.pdf document was implemented in the Flask app to ensure that the logic was implemented in Python.

It starts off with a starting page with a input bar and a add task button
